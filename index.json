You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file and adding markup: mmark to your page front matter.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $$...$$.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ renders as\n\\[\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}\\]\nExample inline math $$\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2$$ renders as \\(\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2\\) .\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ renders as\n\\[f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026 \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026 \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}\\]\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD; A--\u0026gt;B; A--\u0026gt;C; B--\u0026gt;D; C--\u0026gt;D; ``` renders as\ngraph TD; A--\u0026gt;B; A--\u0026gt;C; B--\u0026gt;D; C--\u0026gt;D; An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram participant Alice participant Bob Alice-\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;prevail...
