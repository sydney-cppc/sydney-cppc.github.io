Cosmology and particle physics describe nature at its largest and shortest distances, respectively. Both are intimately linked in the early universe with its extreme conditions of high temperature, densities and energies. This is depicted in the cosmic ouroboros. Our <a href="research">research</a> is focussed on different aspects of this connection.
